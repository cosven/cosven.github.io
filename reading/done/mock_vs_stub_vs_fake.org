- mock: mock 掉的对象是被测的对象。比如我们断言某一个函数会被调用，但又不想真正执行该函数，用 mock
- stub: stub 掉的对象不是被测的对象，它是用来配合测试的。比如一个死板的人造的符合预期的数据
- fake: 对实际系统的简单模拟。比如 python fakeredis。

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Fakes are objects that have working implementations, but not same as production one. Usually they take some shortcut and have simplified version of production code.

Stub is an object that holds predefined data and uses it to answer calls during tests. It is used when we cannot or don’t want to involve objects that would answer with real data or have undesirable side effects.

Mocks are objects that register calls they receive.
In test assertion we can verify on Mocks that all expected actions were performed.
